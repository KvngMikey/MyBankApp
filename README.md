# MyBankApp
This is a fully functional banking application, you would love it.

This is a banking application with two users for now, both users with individual login and accounts.

Users can login to view all thier most recent transactions.

Users can also transfer money to another user or can get a loan from the bank.

There's a dynamic welcome message for each user, localized date and time and also a timer that times a user out after 2mins of inactivity on the app.

There's also a sort button with the functionality to sort transaction movements in an ascending or descending order.
